## Custom Source Control System Tailor made for use with UE 5.3.2

This repository outlines the development of a custom source control system
tailored specifically for Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) projects. This system aims to 
provide a solution for managing large UE5 project files, including Blueprints, 
using a personal computer as the storage server.

## Project Description

The project focuses on developing a source control system from scratch, which 
is optimized for handling large files and complex project structures typical 
in UE5 development. Unlike traditional version control systems like Git, this 
system will utilize direct storage on a personal PC, ensuring efficient 
management of large assets.

### Key Features and Objectives

- **Custom File Management:** Create a system for efficiently handling large UE5 
  project files, including reading, writing, and tracking changes.
- **Direct PC Storage Utilization:** Use a personal, always-on computer as the 
  server for storing and managing project files.
- **Blueprint Integration:** Special focus on UE5 Blueprints, allowing for 
  efficient storage, retrieval, and comparison of Blueprint files.
- **Web Interface:** Develop a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, 
  and JavaScript for easy interaction with the source control system.
- **Backend Development:** Use Node.js to handle server-side logic, file 
  operations, and communication with the storage PC.

## Current Phase: Research and Development

- Researching optimal methods for large file storage and retrieval.
- Exploring efficient algorithms for file comparison and version tracking.
- Prototyping the web interface and backend architecture.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

- A personal PC set up for continuous running.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.

### Initial Configuration

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install Node.js on your system.
3. Follow the setup guide (to be provided) for configuring your PC as a server.

## Usage

Usage instructions and detailed documentation will be provided as the project
progresses.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions, especially in areas like server setup, large file 
handling, and UI/UX design. Guidelines for contributing will be provided soon.

## Custom Versioning System

Our versioning system will be specifically designed for handling large files
and complex UE5 projects. Details will be outlined as development progresses.
