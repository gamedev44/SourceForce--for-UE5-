# Source Force - Custom UE5 Source Control System

Welcome to Source Force, a specialized source control system designed for use with Unreal Engine 5.3.2 Projects. 
This innovative system focuses on efficiently managing large UE5 assets, including Blueprints, and seamlessly integrates modern web development practices with a robust version control system for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

Source Force aims to address the unique challenges associated with UE5 project management and thus aid in making said challenges easier to overcome.

## THE GOAL
by combining html , css & js along with json and binary data we aim to make a simple to use yet somewhat complex Program Capable of ( Large file Storage , Version Control , Binary Data Fetching & Comparison and Direct display of Blueprints Program-Wide )
we will aim to provide an easy to use system with a intuitive user friendly GUI capable of handling large folders and files simultanously via drag and drop and file explorer integration.
also ill be aiming to provide unzip on the fly integration so that one can upload zips and it will exctract and read the data the same as if it were all packed in one folder
also the ability to add a folder complete with multiple subfiles and subfolders will be integrated soon.
withe the ability to automatically recursively scan through all folders subfolders and files etc... seamlessly making your day easier as a developer. . .

### Core Features

- **Custom File Management:** Designed to effectively handle large UE5 project files and assets.
- **Advanced Version Control:** Integrating best practices in VCS for managing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, adapted to the specific needs of UE5 projects.
- **Personal PC as Server:** Using a personal computer as a reliable storage and management server.
- **Web Interface Development:** Crafting a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Node.js for Backend Logic:** Implementing robust server-side operations for efficient file management.

## Version Control Integration for Web Technologies

- **Repository Setup:** Creating repositories to manage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, enabling organized tracking of changes and updates.
- **Branching and Merging Techniques:** Employing branching strategies for feature development, bug fixing, and testing, followed by systematic merging into the main project.
- **Collaborative Development:** Facilitating seamless collaboration among developers using shared repositories, ensuring synchronized and consistent progress.
- **Code Quality Assurance:** Implementing review processes and testing routines to maintain high standards in code quality across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Efficient Deployment:** Streamlining the deployment process to update live versions of the project, ensuring smooth transitions from development to production environments.
